% computes confidence interval
%  - assumes x's are the number of successes in n Bernoulli trials
%  - finds confidence interval around the estimate for p1-p2
%  - with confidence level 1 - alpha
%  - finds a symmetrical two-sided interval, unless one side
%    would cross zero or one, in which case the interval is 
%    offset.
