% computes confidence interval
%  - assumes x is the number of successes in n Bernoulli trials
%  - finds confidence interval around the estimate for p
%  - with confidence level 1 - alpha
%  - method used is based on integrating f(p|x)
%  - finds a symmetrical two-sided interval, unless one side
%    would cross zero or one, in which case the interval is 
%    offset.
%
% Two methods of integration are used -
%  - for small n (n<500), the recursive method is faster
%  - for large n, the numerical integration method is faster
%    even if it weren't, the recursive method overflows the
%    stack for very large n (n>800).
%
% 022300 tdr created
% 022800 tdr changed from numerical integration to CRC recursive soln.
% 030600 tdr changed to use nibp and ribp conditioned on n.
% 033100 tdr changed threshold for using ribp to depend on min(x, n-x) rather than just n.
% 012901 tdr set N_THRES to zero, i.e., always use numerical intergration.  
%   numerical is slower,  taking up to one-third of a second on 800MHz PC
%   recursive has warnings for nchoosek being called with large n.
%   In comparing the CIs on n's between 1 and 400 with alphas of 0.01 and 0.05 and 
%   x's between 0 and n, the differences in the CI limits were all less than 0.001.
