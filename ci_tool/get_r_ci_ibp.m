% file: get_r_ci_ibp.m
% computes confidence interval for a rate estimate using the normal approximation
%  - assumes x is the number of occurrances of an event in area A
%  - finds confidence interval around the estimate for rate R
%  - with confidence level 1 - alpha
%  - method used is based on integrating the Bayesian posterior
%  - finds a symmetrical two-sided interval, unless one side
%    would cross zero or one, in which case the interval is 
%    offset.
%
% This relies upon user routines when using numerical integration method (not recommended):
%  - integrate_poisspdf.m
%  - poisspdf_of_p.m
%  - poisspdf_0ok.m
% and the Stats toolbox (poisspdf.m)
%
% 022300 tdr created
% 022800 tdr changed from numerical integration to CRC recursive soln.
% 030300 tdr re-created a numerical integration method and renamed to nibp.m
% 031600 tdr created poisson version from binomial version
% 031501 tdr adjusted "close_enough" appoach for fixed alpha accuracy
