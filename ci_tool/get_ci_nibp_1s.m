% file: get_ci_nibp_1s.m
% computes confidence interval
%  - x is the number of successes in n Bernoulli trials
%  - finds confidence interval around the estimate for p
%  - with confidence level 1 - alpha
%  - method used is based on integrating f(p|x)
%  - finds two one-sided intervals
%
% This is recursive in n, so the stack gets too large and 
% crashes MatLab if n is too large. n > 5960 crashes my PC.
%
% The search typically converges in less than 15 trials
%
% 082500 tdr created from get_ci_ribp_1s.m
% 012901 tdr we have been forcing the lower one-sided interval to be less than p_hat
%   and the upper to be greater.  This isn't necessarily the case.  Fixed that.
% 031201 tdr changed "close_enough" to fixed 0.00001 (10^-5)
