% computes confidence interval
%  - assumes x is the number of successes in n Bernoulli trials
%  - finds confidence interval around the estimate for p
%  - with confidence level 1 - alpha
%  - method used is based on a normal approximation
%  - finds a symmetrical two-sided interval, unless one side
%    would cross zero or one, in which case the interval is 
%    offset.
