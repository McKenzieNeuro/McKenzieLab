% file: get_r_ci_ibp_1s.m
% computes confidence interval for a rate estimate using the normal approximation
%  - assumes x is the number of occurrances of an event in area A
%  - finds confidence interval around the estimate for rate R
%  - with confidence level 1 - alpha
%  - method used is based on a normal approximation
%  - finds a both the upper and lower one-sided interval
%
% This relies upon user routines when using numerical integration method (not recommended):
%  - integrate_poisspdf.m
%  - poisspdf_of_p.m
%  - poisspdf_0ok.m
% and the Stats toolbox (poisspdf.m)
%
% 012901 tdr created from get_r_ci_ibp.m for one-sided CIs
% 010412 tdr changed close_enough to fixed limit.
