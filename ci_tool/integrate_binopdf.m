% integrate_binpdf.m
% integrates a binomial pdf with respect to p from a to b
%
% 000223 tdr created
% 000304 tdr replaced global variable approach to getting x and n to binopdf.
% 000306 tdr added adjustments to a and b to help quad8 converge quickly.
% 			quad8 has trouble with long stretches of near-zero values
% 			so we try to bound the interval to avoid these regions
% 			x/n is the max
% 000316 tdr made thres dependent on max binopdf value.
% 000331 tdr provided a floor for thres, it was NaN for very small pdf values, i.e., very large n.
% 000331 tdr added error check for returning values of NaN or Inf
% 010126 tdr changed quad8 to quadl per recommendation of MatLab 6 runs
% 010312 tdr added adaptive tolerance to integration.
% 030106 tdr adjusted comments
