% file: get_ci_cs1.m
%
% Purpose: computes confidence intervals on a probability estimate
%
% This routine is more accurate, but slower under some conditions,
% (perhaps two orders-of-magnitude difference - both in run time and accuracy)
% than other methods and does use non-trivial MatLab routines.
%
% See also: get_ci_cs2.m, which is fast, conservative (doesn't understate the CI)
% and does not rely on non-trivial MatLab routines (i.e., could be easily 
% implemented in C).  
%
% Change History:
%  030600 tdr created
%  033100 tdr added can_use_ibp to deal ibp problems
%					ribp fails if n or min(x, n-x) are too big - inaccurate or recursion depth respectively
%					nibp fails if n and min(x, n-x) are too big - binopdf limitation
%  030106 tdr adjusted some comments
