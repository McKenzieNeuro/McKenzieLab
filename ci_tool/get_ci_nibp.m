% file: get_ci_nibp.m
% computes confidence interval
%  - assumes x is the number of successes in n Bernoulli trials
%  - finds confidence interval around the estimate for p
%  - with confidence level 1 - alpha
%  - method used is based on integrating f(p|x)
%  - finds a symmetrical two-sided interval, unless one side
%    would cross zero or one, in which case the interval is 
%    offset.
%
% This relies upon user routines when using numerical integration method (not recommended):
%  - integrate_binopdf3.m
%  - binopdf_of_p.m
%  - binopdf_01ok.m
% and the Stats toolbox (binopdf.m)
%
% The search typically converges in less than 15 trials
%
% 022300 tdr created
% 022800 tdr changed from numerical integration to CRC recursive soln.
% 030300 tdr re-created a numerical integration method and renamed to nibp.m
% 031201 tdr changed "close_enough" to fixed 0.00001 (10^-5)
