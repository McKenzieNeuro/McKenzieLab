retrieved raw signal (head) = [-0.55911653  0.11690582  0.42053819 -0.6671615   1.63772928]
The gabor wavelet transform has successfully been computed with the python and the matlab.
Now we compare them.
Taking the difference between arrays and rounding to 6 decimal places
which is about 5 significant figures; we get
diff = [[0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 ...
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
 [0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]
(diff==0.0).all() = True
