"""
Each feature is a function that takes an array-like 3d segment 
The segemnt has shape (n_raw_chan,n_samples,n_freq_chan)
The feature functions return a dictionary of features
    key   : str   = name of sub-feature
    value : float = value of the feature evaluated
The keys of this returned dictionary are to be used a column names for
the data-frame in which we save our features.

Example 1. Mean Power raw. 
Takes a segment of data which has (for example) 4 raw channels and 41 
freq channels with 10_000 samples.
For each raw channel
    Compute the mean power 
    Save this to dictionary under key=f"mean_power_ch{n_raw_chan}"
Return the dictionary of mean powers

Example 2. Coherence feature.
Takes a segment of data with four raw channels and 41 freq channels
Discard all the freq channels that are convolutions, only keep raw recording
For each pair of raw channels
    Compute the coherence
    Save selected frequencies to dictionary 
Return the dictionary of raw-chan pairwise coherence



Naming Convention:
    ch_raw refers to the raw electrode channel index
    ch_freq refers to the binary (wavelet freq) file channel index


To add a new feature:
    - Write a function that takes a segment and returns a dictionary of features
    - Add a conditional statement in get_feats() that calls that function
        and adds it to the returned dictionary.
    - Append the name of that feature to the FEATURES list in Options.toml
