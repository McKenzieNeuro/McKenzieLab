    The function is named 'absolute' because it measures the absolute

    Parameters
    ----------
    start_seiz : float or int
        The start time of the seizure in question, in seconds. (Relative

        that specify, in seconds, the pre-ictal bin timestamps.

    postictal_delay : int or float
        Specifies post-ictal period after the end of a seizure in seconds
        (e.g. 600)

    bin_names : list
        A list of bin names (strings). Must have length of preictal_bins + 2. 
        This is because we have one single intra-ictal and one single post-
        ictal bin.
